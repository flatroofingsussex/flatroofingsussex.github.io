            <h1>Flat Roofing</h1>
            <p>For domestic and commercial flat roofing projects, we offer a free survey of your roofing in its current state and provide recommendations on the best course of action, before putting together a competitive quote. We will design your flat roof to meet your specific requirements, ensuring all materials meet the highest standards in waterproofing and durability.</p>
            <blockquote>When you sign up for a flat roof, tanking, valley gutter, asphalt steps or a balcony project, you are free to choose a product that fits the job in question and protects against the elements.</blockquote> <p>We offer a three-layer, high performance built-up felt roof system, which comes with a 15 to 25-year guarantee but has already been proven to sometimes last twice as long.  Our mastic asphalt which you can read more about <a href="/services/mastic-asphalt/">here</a> is a specialist product for waterproofing areas. Call us today to discuss your individual requirements.</p>
