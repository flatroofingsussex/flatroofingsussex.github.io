            <h1>Mastic Asphalt</h1>
            <p>As one of the only specialists in mastic asphalt in the Sussex and surrounding areas, we provide our customers with access to one of the most innovative and durable materials on the market today. Mastic asphalt can be used for flat roofing, balconies, valley gutters, steps and even underneath basement rooms for unbeatable tanking protection against internal moisture, inclement weather and the passage of time.</p>
            <p>Mastic asphalt is different from all other roofing materials because it can be used on a variety of indoor and outdoor projects. Made from a mixture of aggregates, binder and filler, mastic asphalt is laid out ‘hot’ and comes in various grades for the job intended i.e. roofing, paving, flooring and tanking. This provides a perfect tried and tested solution for any waterproofing job. </p>
            <blockquote>All of our mastic asphalt projects are carried out in line with recommendations from the Mastic Asphalt Council to ensure high quality, industry leading standards.</blockquote>
